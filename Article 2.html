<h1 style="font-size: 50px;text-align: center;"><b>Planet blue</b></h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">

    We’re referring to earth here (there may be many blue planets by colour, because we know only a certain amount of celestial bodies in the ultimate limitless space).  Here we know that earth is the only planet suitable for life. (Well, there are chances of other planets being suitable for life and we don’t know or maybe life forms are different than the varieties on earth.)<br><br/>
	We know that the reason for earth to be supportive for life forms that is now on earth are so many, suitable amounts of gravity, a thick atmosphere, suitable distance from the primary star, the elements, the ultimate H2O, etc. <br><br/>
The earth being so generous, it supports  hundreds of millions of species (nobody knows actual numbers of species on earth). Each one of them contributes their share towards the balancing of ecosystems.<br>
Apart from those hundreds of millions of species which earth supports there are great apes earth has been supporting from the past 10 million years. The great apes are considered the most intelligent species alive over the earth, (they gave this credit to themselves and we’re not sure whether we could find some more advanced civilization hiding beneath deep seas, having some great technologies) are now called as homo-sapiens or social animals or simply human beings (each and every nomenclature is by themselves).<br>
As the human beings are considered the most intelligent species on earth, they started using their brain to develop and discover, and they discovered so many things that other known species to humans can just look these as fascination (not sure whether they understand these things or not), but ultimately they’re used to this because humans are developing, discovering and inventing gradually. From walking over 4 feet to travelling in zero gravity, from eating the food at spot to preserving it for years, from just relying on hunts for food to millions of combination of dishes to eat, from covering themselves by other animal’s skins to still covering themselves by other animal’s skins (the later one for fun and prestige only, and that too among fellow species), etc.  But most importantly, taking from nature what nature gives itself to extracting from nature.<br>
The most dominating and intelligent species on the planet blue is dominating all life forms present on the planet indeed and controlling them to some extent. And in order to these developments and discoveries, they also discovered that by their activities, millions of other species playing their role in ecosystem balance are being extinct. Something they themselves termed as global warming is said to kill the planet blue with hundreds of millions of species, and by the deeds of homo sapiens only. And they know it. But maybe they're intelligent enough to not understand this or maybe they understand the consequences or they’re just delaying the actions. Or maybe they don’t want the planet to live (maybe they have different plans like - they want to change the colour of the planet blue, or they’re are trying to create another planet blue or maybe they found another planet blue where they can travel and do the same as they did to earth and then find another blue planet and so on.<br>
	As of now, we only have this blue planet, and it should stay blue so that all the lifeforms should be supported including the great homo sapiens.
