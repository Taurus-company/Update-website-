    Skipping a week from city life.

    When we talk about cities, we imagine large skytouching buildings, clean and wide roads, lots of vehicles on roads, fascinating lights, nonstop movements throughout 24 hours of a day, etc. But we miss to imagine those traffics, the loneliness despite having around a lot of people all the time, and the restlessness<br>. Despite all odds millions of people stay in cities, some are residents while some migrated for work, treatment or studies or all of them. And there are a lot of reasons for these- you have 24 hours of electricity, you’ll get a job, you have better opportunities in your studies, you have multi-speciality hospitals which attract people to cities. Cities give a lot of experience to a person, whether it may be in the field of life, in the field of work, in the field of selecting career option or any other thing. But if you’re living in a city, someday you’ll feel like getting far away from this crowd and stay some time in peace, but you need a reason and a place to stay.<br> A lot of  people plan vacations to some hill stations for their families. But most of the families that migrated for job or studies, plan their vacation to their natives, whether that’s a village or a small town or maybe in some cases bigger cities also.
    <br>
    <br/>
        Going for a vacation on hills or any other tourist places is quite fascinating, but that’s not challenging as going to a village with no tourist attractions. If you’re going to any tourist place, you’ll certainly get good mode of transport and a lot of facilities would be provided at the location of your stay (unless or until you went on to extreme places in himalayas, where you can’t even use your money to buy things).
        <br>
    <br/>
        But if you’re going to a village with no tourist attractions, first of all you have to check for nearest railway station or bus station (there are chances that you won’t get flights for those places). Once you reach the destined major station, you can easily see the change in the pattern in every aspect, you’ll see a different pattern in the buildings, a different pattern in the attire of people, a different pattern in almost everything. <br>Then you’ll take public transport (most probably) to reach the village, you’ll be sharing those transports with the local people going on the same route as you’re going. As you proceed along you’ll see differences along the roadside, you’ll notice that the roads are not as smooth as they were in cities and they are also very narrow (but there are only a few vehicles running on the road, so your speed is not compromised due to traffic), but you have fields on both sides of the road as compared to buildings in the cities.<br><br/> As you’re nearing a village, you’ll notice that the frequency of fields have decreased and now you have some single storey houses with shed roofs made up of husks along with some shops and cattles and a hell lot of space in front of their houses (you can feel jealous about the space in their front yard, because your front yard in city house is not large enough to even park a two wheeler).
    <br>
    <br/>
        After experiencing a fascinating view, you’ll reach the village entry road having a milestone with name of the village and distance stating 0 Kms and now you’ll have to let go your public transport, and you’ll probably have to take a manual rickshaw or walk to reach the house you’re going to stay (there are 90 percent chances that you’ll be received by a member from the family you’re staying with). When you take the village road, you’ll notice that the bitumen road has been replaced by water bound macadams. The greenery will be very satisfying and beautiful. You’ll take out your phone and try to capture the beauty of this, but your camera couldn’t capture the beauty the same way your eyes would feel (unless you’re a good photographer). 
    <br>
        When you reach the house you’re staying with you’ll be greeted by a lot of people, not only the members of the house you’re staying with, but also from the neighbouring houses, so basically in village you will have only 1 percent people compared to city, but you will be known by 10 more people than the city. 
    <br>
        In the village you’ll feel very relaxed, because you don’t have to think about deadlines of the project, you don’t have to worry about parking your vehicles, etc. In cities, even if you don’t have any work or deadline, you’ll be tense for no reason but in villages there’s nothing like this, you’ll always feel relaxed. You’ll always be accompanied by someone, means there will always be a person who’ll stay with you and talk to you. You’ll stop seeing people on the streets after 7:00 in the evening. And if you’re lucky enough to visit there during summers you’ll probably sleep in open and then you’ll realise that why in cities we talk a lot about pollution, here you’ll fell asleep gazing at the stars and moon in the clear sky, the streets will be visible only with the lights of the stars in the night and while you were gazing at the stars, you will have no thoughts in your mind.
    <br>
    <br/>
        Unlike cities you won’t see new faces daily in villages, you will not get electricity during the whole 24 hours of the day, you’ll have to use hand pumps or wells to draw water and use them, you won’t get proper networks, you will have to travel so far in order to get to a nearby market, you’ll see a lot of birds which have been extinct from cities, you’ll notice that kids in the villages to to school and help their father in the fields and with the cattles as well (now you can think how you avoid everything in the name of studies & classes), you’ll notice that during functions they don’t hire people to work because the village members do all the workings, you’ll be served with organic food, if not lucky enough you’ll have to go to fields with water bottle in your hand for your nature’s call, you have no good schools or means of higher studies, no good hospitals and healthcare facilities, roads are not very smooth, etc. 
    <br>
        So basically, a lot of things are good and a few things are a matter of concern about villages, but that’s also a case with the cities. People living in cities are fascinated about village life and people living in villages are fascinated about city life.
    <br>
    <br/>
    After completing your tenure in village, you’ll probably return to your home in city with a lot of relaxing memories and motivation for your work until you plan your next vacation.
    
    (I also live in the city, earlier I was studying and now for my job. And as mentioned earlier, you can go along it, but sometimes you feel like getting a break from everything and spend some time in a village. And to do that you need a reason, and most importantly leave from your work. I also got my reason to give a break to my city life for a week in february 2020. One of my friend was getting married,)
